		<p> The gut microbiome has been identified as an important factor associated with numerous conditions and diseases that previously were not known to be related. Microbiome data has been linked to many physiological processes including immune system function, gastrointestinal tract function, sleep quality, and athletic performance as well as indicators for digestive disorders which currently are difficult to diagnose. It is important to translate these complex datasets into actionable reports that could help guide the clinical intervention decisions made by physicians for their patients. <br><br>
		This microbiome analysis tool was created with the goal of providing owners of gut microbiome sample data with a means with which to visualize, interpret, and understand their own microbiome.
		<br><br>
		For more information, please visit the "More Information" tab at the top of the page to learn more about the gut microbiome and common genus types.

		<p> 1. Go to the "My Profile" tab and upload your gut microbiome data files.</br>
		2. Go to the "Analysis Tool" tab to view an analysis of your data.
		<ul>
			<li>Single Sample analysis displays an analysis of a single sample as well as the Shannon Index and Sorensen Index.
				<ul>
					<li>Barchart View: Displays a barchart displaying the selected sample compared to the average sample across the database focusing on the top 10 most abundant genus types in the sample.</li>
					<li>Table View: Displays an easy to read data table that lists the genus types in the sample and their respective genus counts.</li>
					<li>Pie Chart View: Displays the most abundant genus types in your microbiome sample.</li>
				</ul>	
			<li>Temporal Sample analysis displays an analysis of multiple samples with respect to time.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Select and Remove samples that you would like to see compared to each other in a barchart format.</li>
					<li>Select "Show Shannon Index" to see each Shannon Index for the selected samples.</li>
					<li>Select "Show Dates" to see the selected samples across an accurate timeline based on the dates the samples were taken.</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
		3. Go to the "More Information" tab to find videos about the gut microbiome and descriptions of each of the common genus types.</br></br>
