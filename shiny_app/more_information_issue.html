						<i>Purpose and Significance:

						Bifidobacterium are a natural part of the bacterial flora and have a symbiotic bacteria-host relationship with humans.  They are anaerobic branched rod-shaped bacterium.  It occupies a large percentage of the bacterial flora due to its ability to to use a large variety of molecules for energy.  More research is currently being done to further understand its probiotic qualities.  It is found in fermented dairy foods especially yogurt. Bifidobacterium is a probiotic which promotes good digestion, boots the immune system, and produces acids that control intestinal pH.  In the intestines they ferment sugars to produce lactic acid.  The bifidobacterium genome codes for a variety of proteins specializing in the catabolism of small polysaccharides. They are also able to break down many plant polymers or host-derived glycoproteins and glycoconjugates that are considered otherwise non-digestible. Eating substances rich in this probiotic is a common home remedy for diarrhea, vaginitis, and yeast infections because it promotes the growth of these as opposed to other bacteria.  It has been proven to dramatically reduce irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in patients and if given alone can almost normalize the patient.  They regulate the intestinal microbial homeostasis, the inhibition of pathogens and harmful bacteria that colonize or infect the gut mucosa, the modulation of local and systemic immune responses, the repression of procarcinogenic enzymatic activities within the microbiota, the production of vitamins, and the bioconversion of dietary compounds into bioactive molecules.

					<i>Purpose and Significance:

					Enterococci are normally found in the bowel and are the leading cause of secondary infections acquired in the hospital as it is a pathogen. Enterococci is one of the few bacterias that creates a notably large amount of extracellular oxygen and specifically converts carbohydrates to lactic acid.

					<i>Purpose and Significance:

					Lactobacillus is normally found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans. They are believed to provide benefits to the gut by immunomodulation and interference with enteric pathogens. Lactbacilli is considered to have probiotic uses according to some researchers, but this is controversial. These bacteria produce lactic acid to maintain healthy intestinal microflora.

					<i>Purpose and Significance: 
					</i>
					Spherical, immobile and form grape-like clusters, these bacteria are a normal inhabitant of the skin and mucous membranes in the nose.  They differ from streptococci by their division into two planes, not just one.  They grow by fermentation which produces lactic acid.  It is infectious in humans with approximately 30% of the normal healthy population affected by it as it asymptomatically colonizes hosts. It is highly researched as a pathogen because certain strains are resistant to the most powerful antibiotics. The most common strain of staphylococcus bacteria is the most common cause of staph infections.  It is also responsible for a variety of mild skin infections including bacteremia with metastatic complications, cellulitis, carbuncles, endocarditis, folliculitis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia and wound infections.  It can also cause invasive diseases such as boils, emesis, diarrhea, scalded skin syndrome, urinary tract infection and toxic shock syndrome.  Although staphylococcus is an extremely versatile pathogen it only infects immunocompromised humans and infections usually remain isolated at the point of entry by host defenses.
